# NSXTool Documentation

The documentation for NSXTool is generated using
[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) and [Read the
docs](https://readthedocs.org). The prerequisite Python modules can be installed
via the Python package management tool Pip:
    
```
pip install sphinx sphinx-contrib-bibtex sphinx-rtd-theme
```

The documents can then be compiled with by running `make html` from the `doc`
directory. They can be accessed by pointing your browser to
`doc/build/html/index.html`.

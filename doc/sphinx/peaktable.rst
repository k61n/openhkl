Peak Table
===========

The peak table features in many parts of the workflow, and contains (with a few
exceptions) the follwoing columns.

Rejection flags
===============

A peak flagged as "invalid" will not be integrated and is therefore not included
in the merge statistics. The data quality statistics (R-factors and CC-values)
can be indefinitely improved by simply regjected peaks that make them worse, so
some measure of how many peaks were rejected is necessary to ensure the
integrity of the data; this is the completeness, and it is the number of valid
peaks as a fraction of the total number of possible peaks. There are many
possibly reasons why a peak might be rejected; these are listed below.

Rejected during peak finding
----------------------------

* **Masked by user** - the peak intersects a mask applied to the detector image.
  Such masks are applied to exclude problematic regions of the detector, such as
  seams between detector plates and the area surrounding the beam stop.

* **Too many or few detector counts** - a blob must have a number of counts
  within a given range to qualify as a valid peaks. The upper limit is used to
  exlude pixels that have been saturated, i.e. the count is beyond the limit of
  the detector.

* **Peak centre outside frame range** - the centre of mass of the blob falls
  outside the angular region encompassed by the detector images.

* **Peak centre outside detector image** - the centre of mass of the blob falls
  outside the bounds of the detector image.

Rejected during integration
---------------------------

* **Integration failed** - This is a fall-through condition met if the
  integration fails but not for any other of the listed reasons. Should not
  generally happen.

* **Too few points to integrate** - the integration region contains too few
  counts to reliably integrate.

* **No unit cell assigned** - the given peak has no unit cell assigned and can
  not be handled.

* **No associated data set** - The given peak has no data set assigned and can
  not be handled.

* **Integration region extends beyond image/frame range** - The integration
  region extends either beyond the detector image, or outside the frame
  (rotation) range.

* **Negative, zero, or undefined background sigma** - certain rare circumstances
  might lead to a mathematically undefined sigma.

* **Peak contains saturated pixel** - A 16-bit detector can hold a maximum of
  65535 counts per pixel. Moreover, there is physical limit to the number of
  counts a detector pixel can reach. If the integrator is instructed to reject
  peaks containing such pixels, this reason is used.

* **Adjacent peak intensity region overlaps this peak** - if two peak intensity
  regions overlap, both peaks are rejected.

* **Centre of mass of peak is inconsistent** - the centre of
  mass of the peak is mathematically undefined.

* **Covariance matrix of peak is inconsistent** - the shape of the ellipsoid
  defining the peak, i.e. the covariance matrix, is mathematically undefined.

* **Shape of peak is too small or large** - the eigenvalues of the covariance
  matrix of the ellipsoid are too small or large.

* **Failed to find a minimum of I/Sigma** - specific to the :math:`\sigma/I`
  integrator, which requires a minimum in :math:`I/\sigma` to determine the
  extents of the integration region.

* **Peak centre moved beyond bounds of data set** - specific to the Gaussian
  integrator: the peak centre may move outside the bounds of the image or frame
  range during integration.

* **Pearson coefficient of fit is too low** - specific to the Gaussian
  Integrator: the fit of the peak shape is not good enough.

* **No shape model found** - No shape model was specified during profile
  integration.

Rejected during shape prediction
--------------------------------

* **No neighbouring profile to compute shape** - There are no neighbouring peaks
  within the specified pixel and frame range cutoffs with which to compute a
  mean covariance.

* **Too few neighbouring profiles to compute shape** There are too few
  neighbouring peaks within the specified pixel and frame range cutoffs with
  which to compute a mean covariance.

Rejected during refinement
--------------------------

* **Failure updating prediction post-refinement** - the reflection no longer
  intersects the Ewald sphere after refinement.

Other
-----

* **Frame coordinate interpolation failed** - The fractional frame value (i.e.
  specific rotation angle) cannot be determined because the ellipsoid extends
  beyond the frame range.

* **Manually unselected by user** - peak can be manually deselected form the
  detector image by selecting one or many peaks with the rectangle select tool,
  then pressing backspace.

* **Outside indexing tolerance** - The non-integer Miller indices (the product
  of a reciprocal vector and reciprocal basis) are too far from the specified
  integer Miller indices.

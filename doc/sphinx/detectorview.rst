.. _detectorview:

Detector view window
====================

The ``Experiment``, ``Find peaks``, ``Peak filter`` and ``Predictor`` tabs all have
detector view panels, but these are contain only *contextual* information
related to the tab they reside in. A general purpose detector view window can be
opened from the ``View`` menu, and can be used to visualise data from all parts of
the workflow.

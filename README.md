# NSXTool

## Provisional installation instructions (Development version)

### Linux

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://jugit.fz-juelich.de/mlz/nsxtool.git
```

2. Install global dependencies. These are generally installed at a system level via a package management system on Linux or MacOS.
    1. cmake
    2. C++ compiler (generally g++ or clang for Linux)
    3. Python3 interpreter
	4. HDF5 - assuming this is installed on the system level, it will be located automatically
    5. QT5
    6. QCustomPlot2
    7. Eigen3
    8. YAMLCpp
    9. Boost
    10. GSL
    11. FFTW3
    12. Blosc

3. Install local dependencies. Assuming here that they are being installed in `~/Software`, which contains the directories `include` and `lib` with various headers and libraries installed.
    1. XSection (https://jugit.fz-juelich.de/mlz/xsection)
    2. QCR (https://jugit.fz-juelich.de/mlz/libqcr)

```
git clone https://jugit.fz-juelich.de/mlz/repo.git # Assuming this is now in directory "repo"
cd repo
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/Software ..
make
make install
```

4. Run `cmake`, and `make`:
```
cd /path/to/nsxtool
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/Software ..
make
```

5. Note that at present, NSXTool has no `make install` target, so the code must be run from the `build` directory. The GUI executable is `build/main/NSXTool`. The Python scripts access a SWIG-generated shared library interfaced via `build/swig/pynsx.py`, which should be added to the `PYTHONPATH` environmental variable:
```
PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/nsxtool/build/swig
```

### MacOS (Catalina)

This is largely the same as for Linux, but I use Homebrew [brew.sh](brew.sh), but beware that if you have multiple package managers on MacOS, they can interfere and break something critical. Homebrew will also install any higher order dependencies you need.

```
brew install python3 cmake boost qt5 eigen hdf5 swig c-blosc fftw cpp-gsl
pip3 install numpy scipy
```

Homebrew does not add QT5 paths to /usr/local/bin, so you will need to use the follwing argument when running `cmake`:

```
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/local/opt/qt ..
```

`QCustomPlot` is not available via Homebrew, so you will have to [download](www.qcustomplot.com) the both the source and shared library compilation packages. The installation instructions are provided, but to summarise them:
1. Download the [source](https://www.qcustomplot.com/release/2.0.1/QCustomPlot-source.tar.gz)
2. Download the [shared library configuration scripts](https://www.qcusmplot.com/release/2.0.1/QCustomPlot-sharedlib.tar.gz)
3. Unpack the source to some directory, e.g. `~/Software/qcustomplot`
4. Unpack the shared library scripts to the root directory containing the source, `~/Software/qcustomplot`
5. Go to `~/Software/qcustomplot/sharedlibs/sharedlib-compilation`
6. Run `qmake` followed by `make`. This will generate two libraries and some symlinks of the form `libqcustomplot.dylib` and `libqcustomplotd.dylib`, the latter of which contains debugging flags, and you can ignore.

Things are complicated by the fact that there is no `make install` target for these libraries, which will normally set the correct `rpath` metadata in the shared library file. In this instance, the `rpath` variable is not set, as evidenced by the `otool` output:

```
$ otool -D libqcustomplot.dylib
libqcustomplot.dylib:
libqcustomplot.2.dylib
```

The correct path can be set using `install_name_tool`, and the correct path confirmed via `otool`:
```
$ install_name_tool -id "@rpath/libqcustomplot.dylib" libqcustomplot.dylib

$ otool -D libqcustomplot.dylib
libqcustomplot.dylib:
@rpath/libqcustomplot.2.dylib
```

Without this fix, `cmake` will use the `libqcustomplot.dylib` metadata to set the path to the library, and not be able to find it. Although the code will compile, it will crash at runtime with an error message resembling,

```
dyld: Library not loaded: libqcustomplot.dylib
  Referenced from: ./main/NSXTool
  Reason: image not found
```

The NSXTool executable can be checked using `otool` from the NSXTool build directory:

```
$ otool -L main/NSXTool

...
@rpath/libxsection.0.dylib (compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 0.1.0)
@rpath/libQCR.0.dylib (cmopatibility version 0.0.0, current version 0.2.0)
@rpath/libqcustomplot.dylib (compatibility version 2.0.0, current version 2.0.1)
...
```

Without the fix, the QCustomPlot line would read `libqcustomplot.dylib (compatibility version 2.0.0, current version 2.0.1)`.

The rest of the compilation prodedure is step 3 of the Linux instructions onwards. The only difference is that `cmake` must be pointed towards `libqcustomplot.dylib` and `qcustomplot.h`. This can either be achieved by simply copying the shared libraries to the directory referenced by the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` variable, in my case `~/Software`, before running `install_name_tool` as above.

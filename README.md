# OpenHKL

## Building Docker images

This is an orphaned, empty branch for building docker images. It contains only
the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file for triggering the Docker-in-Docker pipelines for
generating images containing the correct environment, and a subdirectory of
`docker` for each different image to build.

//! \brief Class ConvexHull.
//! This class implements an templated object-oriented adaptation of the 3D incremental convex hull
//! algorithm whose implementation in C has been described in:
//! o'Rourke, Joseph. Computational geometry in C. Cambridge university press, 1998. 115-144.
//!
//! Basically, the algorithm works on the same way than for the 2D case. It works by building counter clockwise
//! oriented faces (triangles) of the hull and at each step a new point is defined to be part of the hull if its
//! signed volume is negative for at least one face. Otherwise the point is discarded. When a point is added to
//! the hull, this one is extended by building new faces that link the point to the edges of the visible faces of
//! the hull from that point. After that step, the hull is updated by removing the faces (and their corresponding
//! edges) that has been completety "buried" by the hull growth.
//!
//! Some of the methods names have been renamed regarding to the C implementation because we felt more comfortable
//! with during those names in the curse of the implementation. In such case the original name will be recalled
//! when documenting those methods.

/*! \brief A template class to handle binary trees in D dimensions
 *
 * Octree is used to partition space in D dimensions and employed for fast sorting
 * or collision detections of AABB objects. NdTree derived from AABB since each
 * voxel is a bounded object itself. The root node has dimensions of the full world.
 * The Octree instance does not own the AABB* objects: since users deals with
 * the lifetime of AABB* objects outside of the class, one must ensure that these
 * have a greater lifetime than that of NdTree. Octree define a soft constraint on the
 * the maximum number of AABB* objects that can be stored in each leaf of the tree (_MAX_STORAGE),
 * and a maximal depth for each branch (_MAX_DEPTH). If the number of subdivisions reaches
 * _MAX_DEPTH, the soft constraint on _MAX_STORAGE is broken.

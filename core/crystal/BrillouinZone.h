//! \class BrillouinZone
//! \brief Class to calculate first Brillouin zone of a lattice and to convert
//! it to a convex hull representation. The first Brillouin zone of a lattice is
//! defined to be the set of all vectors which are closer to the origin than to
//! any other lattice point. From this definition, it comes that it is a convex
//! hull bounded by Bragg planes, i.e. planes with normal vector q passing
//! through the point q/2 for lattice vectors q. Hence, to construct the
//! Brillouin zone, one has to enumerate the finitely many q's which appear as
//! normals to the faces of the zone. Then, the bouding vertices are determined
//! by taking 3-fold intersections of the bounding planes.
class BrillouinZone {

    //! Create a Brillouin zone out of the given (row) basis matrix B.
    BrillouinZone(const Eigen::Matrix3d& B, double eps = 1e-6);

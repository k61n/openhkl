/*! A template class to handle binary trees in D dimensions
 *
 * Octree is used to partition space in D dimensions and employed for fast
 * sorting or collision detections of AABB objects. NdTree derived from AABB
 * since each voxel is a bounded object itself. The root node has dimensions of
 * the full world. The Octree instance does not own the AABB* objects: since
 * users deals with the lifetime of AABB* objects outside of the class, one must
 * ensure that these have a greater lifetime than that of NdTree. Octree define
 * a soft constraint on the the maximum number of AABB* objects that can be
 * stored in each leaf of the tree (_MAX_STORAGE), and a maximal depth for each
 * branch (_MAX_DEPTH). If the number of subdivisions reaches _MAX_DEPTH, the
 * soft constraint on _MAX_STORAGE is broken.

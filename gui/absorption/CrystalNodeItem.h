//! @class CrystalNodeItem: Class uded to define points on a crystal.
//! In order to work, the center of rotation must be
//! set using the static method setCenter.
//! Each node is first selected by invoking the
//! initiate method which set the position of a point
//! using the screen coordinates (x,y) and the rotation angle
//! of the crystal at which the image was recorded.
//! The second step is to invoke the method adjust
//! at a different crystal angle, which determines the
//! missing coordinate. The node is displayed as an ellipse
//! with set colors and respond to mouse interaction.

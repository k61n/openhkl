#### [develop] Changes since 2021-06-19T00 until 2021-08-12T00

Added/Improved
-----
* Core:
  * Merge and compute R-factors of _found_ peaks only. #285
  * Added completeness to saved statistics. #307
  * Added per-resolution shell computation of completeness. #137
  * Added real-space residual for refining (experimental). #304
  * Modified overlap filter criteria to reject colliding intensity regions, instead of colliding intensity/background regions.
  * Remove overlapping peaks during integration. #282
  * Integration/prediction no longer loops over numors. #300 and #293
  * Integration improvements: #314 and #309
    - Added several new rejection flags to the integration process, and their respective checks in all integrators.
  * NSX new data storage format:
    - Introduced the new NSX data storage format v1.0 (Backward-incompatible)
      + The structure of the NSX data storage format is simplified and improved.
      + Removed duplicate code to export/import HDF5 files in order to avoid inconsistencies. Improve the safety and uniformity of the HDF5 importers.
      + Removed the legacy HDF5 reader to have a _single_ data storage format.
      + Removed duplicate instances of HDF5 Blosc-Filter definition. A dedicated module, `HDF5BloscFilter`, is used to avoid resource leaks.
      + Disentangled DataSet and DataReaders to avoid inconsistent states of DataSet depending on the order of execution and data duplication. #262
  * Removed boost, ILLDataReader and associated tests. #16 and #279
  * Refactored core to avoid code duplication or unused code. #305, #306 and #276

* GUI:
  * Added direct beam position to SubframeRefiner; on refinement, the direct beam position pre- and post-refinement will be displayed. #330
  * Added a visualisation for the direct beam centre on `DetectorScene`. #283
  * Added a simple mechanism to store data on the currently opened datafile. #320
  * Added a detector image to `SubframeRefiner`. #329
    Upon clicking 'Update peaks' in `DetectorWidget` in `SubframeRefiner`, the predicted peaks collection are cloned locally and the original predicted collection is updated, allowing the user to visually see the effect of refinement on the peak centres.
  * Added intensity slider to `DetectorWindow`. #244
  * Added controls to GUI to switch between cells from last refinement and cell from autoindexer.
    - Unit cell are chosen per batch according to which unit cell is assigned to the most peaks in that batch. #338
    - Refiner can now use cells generated from last refinement. #328
  * Improved detector masking functionality. #254
  * Added frame range to `SubframeMergedPeaks` in order to limit the R-factor calculation to a subset of frames. #193
  * Improved `QComboBox` updating via a Sentinel. #272 and #237
  * Improved integration: #314 and #309
    - Removed some now-redundant counters from ShapeCollection, these are now covered by rejection flags.
    - Improved the prediction workflow such that shapes can be assigned to predicted peaks straight after predictions.
    - Mosaicity and Beam divergence sigma `QSpinBoxes` allow visualisation of the direct affect of changing them (after integrating and assigning shapes).
  * Added subframe 'Integrate'. #262
    Decoupled shape collection building and prediction, so that a shape collection is now no longer required to predict peaks. Predicted peaks are discarded at the point of integration if their profiles are invalid.
  * Added a mechanism to propagate changes to the parameters consistently to the whole GUI
    - Made parameter setting/getting consistent across Subframes. #296
    - Parameter values now saved centrally with no duplication, saved across refreshes. #294
  * Re-implemented removeExperiment. #260
  * Implemented a mechanism to display log messages in a separate window in the GUI. #161
  * Added status-bar messages to inform GUI activities.
  * Added new sidebar icons for dark and light themes. #287
  * Improved GUI safety to avoid crashes. Reduce code duplication.

Fixed
-----
* GUI:
  * Gracefully kill the `DetectorWindow` on `MainWin` shutdown. #239
  * Fail gracefully when trying to create a data file to export experiments. #320
  * Reset states and batches between refinements to avoid refiner crash when switching residuals between refinements. #324
  * Disallow creating peak collection in `SubframeFindPeaks`, when the peaks are not integrated.
  * Add a Project to the projects list only if loading the Experiment was successful (to avoid a crash). #262
  * Fixed the crash which occured when the refiner was used twice. #334
  * Fixed the crash which occured after cancelling the Load experiment action in menu. #323
  * Fixed calculate profile in `ShapeCollectionDialog`. #322
  * Fixed the incorrect aspect ratio of detector image on first load. #270
  * Fixed the crash in merge section when calculate/displaying R-factors for "find" peak collection. #289
  * Fixed pixel-sum integrator crash in SubframeIntegrator. #288
  * Fixed text colour for light theme sidebar.
  * Fixed Qt warnings. #235



### [develop] Changes since 2021-06-01T00 until 2021-06-19T00

Added/Changed
-----
* Core:
** Modify the bisecting algorithm so that all intervals are checked for a solution. #265
** Remove the spurious predicted peaks which intersect the beam stop. #267
** Unselect unintegrable peaks during prediction, rather than skipping. #266

* GUI:
** GUI-Session: Prevent loading data before an Experiment is created, in order to avoid unexpected behaviour. #224
** Display all source files of a DataSet as a scrollable dropdown list, and store them as a comma-separated string in the metadata. #89 #87
** Ask for a name when a new DataSet is added; warn against overwriting previous names via a confirmation dialog.
** Update DetectorWindow combo-boxes when peak collection is added.

Fixed
-----
* Core:
  * Fixed many problems with merge statistics. #280 and #274
    - Merge symmetry-related peaks within a set of predicted peaks (instead of merging two peak collections).
    - Proper handling of intensities (background and raw) with zero, negative or undefined sigmas.


* GUI:
** Fix SubframeExperiment detector scene to match other subframes. #251
** Fix 'd-min' issue (bisection algorithm). #204, #223
